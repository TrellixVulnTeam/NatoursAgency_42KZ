<h5>Before you proceed with HTML Natours Template installation, you need to prepare. It is recommended to follow steps, listed below:</h5>

<h3>Software</h3>

<p>We recommend that you download all the required software to edit Website Template. Software Required is listed at template preview page.</p>

<p>Technical requirements might differ depending on exact template, therefore we will list the most basic ones:</p>

<ol class="index-list">
    <li>First, you'll need proper unzipping software #########.zip package extracting. You
        may use WinZip 9+ (Windows) and Stuffit Expander 10+ (Mac) and unrar for Linux . This is a mandatory software.
    </li>
    
    <li>You should also use code editor, i. e. Sublime Text, Notepad++, Atom, Visual Studio Code etc. for template files source code
        editing.
    </li>
    <li>For files uploading to server FTP manager will be also required, like FileManager at your hosting control panel or
        desktop applications, such as Total Commander, FileZilla, CuteFTP, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      We highly recommend you to use Koala for SCSS compilation, ex. program Prepros.
    </li>
</ol>



<h3>Hosting</h3>

<p>You can just run index.html file directly from your site folder, but it won't let you explore all template functionality. You should upload template to hosting server in order to display a fully working website correctly.</p>

<p>In case you have existing server already, please check if it meets Website Template requirements, listed at template preview page. </p>

<p>You may also install Website Template to your computer locally by using localhost if you want to add server-side functionality . In order to set up local server you may use WAMP, AppServ, MAMP, XAMPP or any similar software. All of them are installed same as regular application.</p>

<h6>Feel free to check the following tutorials on how to set up local server:</h6>

</ul>

<h3>Template upload</h3>

<p>You need to upload all files of site/ folder from your localhost to hosting.</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">
  Note: the root directory of a site depends on the internal structure of your hosting server.
  If you upload the site folder itself on hosting, the root of your site will be <b>http://your_domain_name/site.</b>
  You need to upload inner content of site/ folder if you want url to be <b>http://your_domain_name/</b>
</p>

<p class="alert alert-danger">Warning: do not upload <b> SASS</b> folder, or any of the source template files to your hosting server.</p></article></section>                </div>
